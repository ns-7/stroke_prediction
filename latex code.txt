  Strokes pose a significant global health challenge, leading to high mortality and morbidity rates. Early identification of individuals at risk of stroke is crucial for implementing preventive measures and timely interventions. In this project, we employ advanced machine learning techniques to predict strokes and explore the relationships between demographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors and stroke occurrence. The purpose of our study is to develop a robust and accurate predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals and designing targeted interventions for stroke prevention.

We utilize the Stroke Prediction dataset, which consists of a large sample size and includes various features such as age, gender, average glucose level, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, and smoking status. The dataset requires preprocessing steps to handle missing values, address data inconsistencies, and ensure data quality. Additionally, we conduct feature engineering to extract relevant information from the available features, including creating binary indicators for hypertension and heart disease.

To train and evaluate our predictive model, we split the dataset into training and testing sets. We employ the catboost algorithm and evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, we conduct cross-validation to assess the model's generalization capability.

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our predictive model in identifying individuals at risk of stroke. The inclusion of lifestyle factors, such as smoking status and BMI, significantly improves the predictive performance, highlighting their importance as risk factors. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including the reliance on a single dataset and the need for external validation. Future work should consider incorporating additional datasets and exploring advanced machine learning techniques to enhance prediction accuracy. Overall, our project aims to contribute to stroke prediction efforts and provide valuable insights for targeted stroke prevention and management strategies.

\section{Introduction}
Strokes pose a significant global health challenge, characterized by high rates of mortality and morbidity. Timely identification of individuals at risk of stroke is of utmost importance to implement preventive measures and timely interventions. This data science project aims to predict strokes by harnessing the power of advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing the comprehensive Stroke Prediction dataset, we delve into the relationships between demographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors, seeking to uncover patterns and insights that contribute to stroke occurrences.

The primary goal of this project is to develop accurate and reliable predictive models for stroke identification. By applying cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to the extensive dataset, we aim to identify key risk factors and their interactions that contribute to the occurrence of strokes. The outcomes of this analysis hold great potential in assisting healthcare professionals in identifying individuals who are at a higher risk of experiencing a stroke. This, in turn, enables the design and implementation of targeted interventions and preventive strategies to mitigate the impact of strokes on affected individuals and healthcare systems.

This project aspires to leverage the power of data science and machine learning to improve stroke prediction and prevention efforts. By shedding light on the complex interplay between various factors and stroke occurrences, we aim to provide valuable insights that can contribute to more effective healthcare strategies and positively impact public health outcomes.



\section{Related Work}
Previous studies have investigated stroke prediction using various methods.  employed a decision tree algorithm on a similar dataset and achieved an accuracy of XX. However, their study did not consider the impact of lifestyle factors. In contrast, we used logistic regression and included lifestyle factors, resulting in improved prediction performance. Our analysis builds upon these works by incorporating advanced feature engineering techniques and model selection methods to develop a more accurate predictive model for stroke occurrence.
\label{gen_inst}


\section{Materials and Methods}
For our analysis, we leverage the Stroke Prediction dataset obtained from Kaggle, comprising a substantial sample size of  instances and encompassing  distinct features. The dataset provides a comprehensive range of variables, including crucial factors such as age, gender, average glucose level, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, and several others relevant to stroke prediction.

However, before delving into the analysis, it is imperative to conduct preprocessing steps to ensure the quality and integrity of the data. This entails addressing missing values and resolving any data inconsistencies that may exist within the dataset. By performing these necessary preprocessing steps, we aim to ensure the reliability and accuracy of our subsequent analysis.

Handling missing values involves carefully examining the dataset and employing appropriate techniques, such as imputation or exclusion, to account for any missing or incomplete data points. This step is crucial to avoid biased or misleading results due to missing information.

Additionally, data inconsistencies may arise from errors during data collection or recording processes. Therefore, it becomes essential to identify and rectify such inconsistencies through data cleaning techniques, which may include resolving discrepancies, standardizing formats, and eliminating outliers.

By meticulously addressing these preprocessing steps, we aim to enhance the overall quality of the Stroke Prediction dataset, ensuring that our subsequent analysis is based on reliable and accurate information. This rigorous data preparation process sets the foundation for robust and meaningful insights regarding stroke prediction in our study.

\section{Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering}
To address missing values in the Stroke Prediction dataset, we employ the XXXX method, a widely used technique known for its effectiveness in handling missing data. This method carefully imputes missing values based on statistical measures, ensuring minimal impact on the overall dataset integrity.

Furthermore, to tackle data inconsistencies, we conduct a thorough examination of the dataset, identifying and resolving any discrepancies or anomalies that may compromise the accuracy of our analysis. This involves performing data validation checks, cross-referencing information, and applying appropriate data cleaning techniques to ensure coherence and consistency throughout the dataset.

In addition to preprocessing steps, we engage in feature engineering to extract additional relevant information from the available features. This includes creating binary indicators for hypertension and heart disease, allowing us to capture the presence or absence of these conditions as categorical variables. This feature engineering approach expands the scope of our analysis, enabling us to consider the impact of these specific health factors on stroke prediction more effectively.

By implementing these preprocessing techniques, we strive to ensure that our subsequent analysis is based on a robust and high-quality dataset, setting the stage for accurate and reliable insights into stroke prediction.


\section{Modeling}
To predict stroke occurrence, we employ the catboost algorithm. We split the dataset into training and testing sets and train the model on the training set. We evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We also conduct cross-validation to assess the model's generalization capability


\section{Results}
Our analysis achieves promising results in predicting stroke occurrence. The lassoCV algorithm achieves an accuracy of XX on the test set. The precision, recall, and F1-score are XX, XX, and XX, respectively. The cross-validation results indicate a stable performance with an average accuracy of XX%

\section{Discussion}
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our predictive model in identifying individuals at risk of stroke. The inclusion of lifestyle factors, such as smoking status and BMI, improves the predictive performance, highlighting their importance as risk factors. However, there are limitations to our analysis, such as the reliance on a single dataset and the need for external validation. Future work should consider incorporating additional datasets and exploring advanced machine learning techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.
