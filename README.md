Context
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

Attribute Information
id: unique identifier
gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"
age: age of the patient
hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
ever_married: "No" or "Yes"
work_type: "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"
Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"
avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood
bmi: body mass index
smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"*
stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not
Note: "Unknown" in smoking_status means that the information is unavailable for this patient.

the file will contain the code used for the project and the datasets used both synthetic and real world data.
to use this projectt you have to have a kaggle account and upload the code and datasets.
after that you can test and calculate the prediction accuracy and get all the information about it.
